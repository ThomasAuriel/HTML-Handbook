According to the [official website](#https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) :

	Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

	Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online Dingus.

**In this handbook you only need to write your text according to the Markdown syntax.**

For more information, the JavaScript API used in this handbook is **[Markdown-it]**

You can also insert HTML tags in the content. However, be warned that it can be unstable since CreateHandbook.jar use the java XML api [javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilder.html). The tag img which is usually not closed, should be when you want to use it. But simple and most other common HTML tags should work.
