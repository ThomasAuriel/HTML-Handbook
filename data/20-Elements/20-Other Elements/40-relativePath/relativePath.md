title: Relative Path
id: relative-path
```

If you share note, or reorganize your notes, it can be convenient to define relative path to resources. To do this, use a relative path as : `![image]( ./image.png)` (without white space in the path). In this case, the targeted image is in the same folder than the note. This becomes `![image](./image.png)`
