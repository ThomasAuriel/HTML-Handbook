- Encoder now puts quotes around asterisk (*)and ampersand(&)
- fix for escaping of quotes (")
- opened up the scope of fields in Wrapper class to protected
- Fixed unescaping: only escaped characters inside double quoted strings are unescaped during parser
- Fixed weird bug due to unhandled \r\n for dos style line breaks in the parser
- Fixed bug where extra invalid content after a valid YAML document is ignored, this was very confusing because invalid documents were parsered successfully with unexpected results.
