RELEASE NOTES for JYaml 1.3:
  Summary: |
    Still maintaining. 
  Bugs closed:
    - Encoder now puts quotes around asterisk (*)and ampersand(&)
    - fix for escaping of quotes (")
    - opened up the scope of fields in Wrapper class to protected
    - Fixed unescaping: only escaped characters inside double quoted strings are unescaped during parser
    - Fixed weird bug due to unhandled \r\n for dos style line breaks in the parser
    - Fixed bug where extra invalid content after a valid YAML document is ignored, this was very confusing because invalid documents were parsered successfully with unexpected results.
